# IsingUtilities.jl
A package containing algorithms and utilites I'm using for my undergraduate thesis regarding the Ising Model

**NOTE** -- This is NOT meant to be a package available for public use. This is only to make my life easier.
The code in this package is not well written and may not be easily accessibly and is definitely not well tested.
You are better off using this as a reference to write your own code at best. If you use this, expect things to
break.
